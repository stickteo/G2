# G2

reads in a monochrome BMP font file to generate a bitmap file

### BMP
- 128*128 px
- 8*8 char blocks
- 256 blocks / glyphs
- monochrome
- white = 1, black = 0
- compatible format generated by Paint.NET by saving image as BMP with 1-bit bit depth

### BITMAP
- 8 bytes per glyph
- 1st byte is top row... 8th byte is bottom row
- most significant bit is left-most pixel... least significant bit is right-most pixel

### Notes
- Though 1-bit BMP stores already pixels as bitmaps, the bytes are arranged in the wrong order...
- Technically we could simply have an image that is 8x2048px... However, that would be inconvinient to edit.
- So opting to keep things simple (and simply rearrange bytes around)... A lot of constraints are assumed.
- Mainly trying to get a balance between using existing tools and minimizing complexity.
